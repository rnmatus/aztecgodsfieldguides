       <p>The Aztecs had hundreds of different gods and goddesses—one for every aspect
         of their lives. The various deities were believed to exert immense power and 
         influence over everything people did and, as a result, were worshipped devoutly
    by all levels of society, both at domestic shrines and also in elaborate public 
    rituals. These ceremonies, led by priests who often “became” gods during the ceremony,
     were highly theatrical and dramatic affairs, integrating festive dancing in 
    fantastic costumes with bloody human sacrifice, which was thought to be necessary
    to continue and keep in balance the cycle of life and death.</p>

            <h7>Toxcatl</h7>
            <p>Toxcatl was the name of the fifth twenty-day month or "veintena" of the Aztec 
            calendar which lasted approximately from the 5th to the 22nd May, and of the 
            festival which was held every year in this month. The Festival of Toxcatl was
            dedicated to the god Tezcatlipoca and featured the sacrifice of a young man
            who had been impersonating the deity for a full year. During the toxcatl he would 
        play the flutes and break them as he went up the temple's stairs up until the moment 
        of his sacrifice.

            <h7>Huitzilipochtli</h7>
            <p>The Aztecs believed that the sun god needed daily nourishment
        (tlaxcaltiliztli) in the form of human blood and hearts and 
        that they, as “people of the sun,” were required to provide
        Huitzilopochtli with his sustenance. It was believed 
        that after their death the warriors first formed part of the sun’s 
        brilliant retinue; then after four years they went to live forever 
        in the bodies of hummingbirds.</p>

            <h7>Tlacaxipehualiztli</h7>
            <p>This ceremony honored the god of vegetation, Xipe Totec. This fertility
                 ritual required the sacrifice of captured warriors. Their
                  skin was flayed from them after death, and the priests of 
                  Xipe Totec wore these human skins for the 20 days of the
                   ceremony, which also featured gladiatorial battles and
                    military ceremonies.

            <h7>Nemontemi</h7>
            <p>In Aztec rituals, at the end of every 360 day year was
                the time of Nemontemi, a period of five days to even
                out the 365 days of a solar year. This was a time of 
                bad luck, and all stayed in their houses, eating little
                 or fasting, waiting for the five days to pass. No religious 
                 ceremonies took place and no business was done.</p>
