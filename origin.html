            <h9>THE CREATION</h9>
        <p>  Aztec culture was very vast with the creation of the Gods; 
             they practically had one for every moment of their life
             or everyday activities. Some of the Gods were aquatic, 
             such as  Acuecucyoticihuati the goddess of the seas and 
             rivers, meanwhile others like Huitzilopochtli were adored 
             to maintain the sun firm on the horizon everyday.  In the 
             first sky the Moon and the clouds move. Here lives Meztli,
            the Moon; Tlazolteotl, the filth eater; Tiacapan, the older
            sister, the one she guides; Ixcuina, the one that removes 
            her face; Tecotzin or Teicu, the youngest. All of them 
            represent the phases of the Moon. </p>

            <h9>THE UNDERWORLD</h9>
        <p> This site has nothing to do with the Christian hell, although it is
             below the earth like that one, it is the place where all the beings
              who have died have to go to discarnate and for their soul to reach
               its most pure. Depending on the way they die, they can go to different 
               places where they will reach eternal rest.
               <br>
               The underworld is made up of nine levels starting with the one just
                below the earth’s surface. On the first level newcomers ford a river 
                with the help of a dog, hence the custom of venerating them and treating
                 them with respect. The second layer has two large mountains that
                 approach and move away preventing the dead from passing.

            <h9>THE SUNS</h9>
        <p> Underlying Aztec religious beliefs was the Legend of
             the Suns, the explanation of the origin of the universe. 
             According to legend, the universe had been created and 
             destroyed four previous times, and each creation formed
              an age called a “sun.” The fifth epoch began in darkness. 
              The gods gathered at Teotihuacan, and two of them sacrificed 
              themselves by jumping into a fire and rising as the sun and
               the moon. The remaining gods then sacrificed themselves,
                their blood setting the sun and moon in motion.
