                <p>There are between 1.5 and 2 million people today who continue to
                     speak Nahuatl, the Aztec language, and many are directly descended
                      from the Aztecs themselves. The conquest destroyed cities but 
                      left most rural communities intact and many small villages 
                      continue to be inhabited by Aztecs to the present day.

                A noble priest class played an integral role in the religious worship
                 and sacrifices of Aztec society. They were responsible for collecting 
                 tributes and ensuring there were enough goods for sacrificial ceremonies.
                They also trained young men to impersonate various deities for an entire 
                year before being sacrificed on a specific day.  These priests were 
                respected by all of society andalso practiced bloodletting on themselves at regular intervals.

            Priests performed rituals from special temples and religious houses.
             The temples were generally huge pyramidal structures that were covered 
             over with a new surface every fifty-two years, meaning some pyramids were 
             gigantic in scale. These feats of architectural display were the sites
            of large sacrificial offerings and festivals, where Spanish reports 
            said blood would run down the steps of the pyramids.

          <div class="calendar">
            <h7>Calendar</h7><br>
            The Aztecs based their calendar on the sun and utilized a 365-day religious 
            calendar. It was split into eighteen twenty-day months, and each month had
             its own religious, and often agricultural, theme. For example, the late
            winter month Altcahualo fell between February 14 and March 5 and represented 
            a time of sowing crops and fertility.
